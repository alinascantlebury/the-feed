          <div class="text">The future of the internet is going to be even more all encompassing. With the advancement of immersive technologies like the metaverse and a greater emphasis on decentralization, I am excited to see how these innovations will reshape the way we connect, create, and share knowledge. I imagine a digital landscape where boundaries between the physical and virtual blur, allowing people to collaborate across the globe in more immersive and equitable ways. The rise of decentralization also brings the possibility of greater user control, transparency, and freedom from centralized gatekeepers. Overall, I feel both hopeful and inspired by the idea that the internet will continue evolving into a space of creativity, inclusivity, and limitless exploration. </div>

    <h2 id = reflection>I unquestionably believe that more people need to venture out of the big corporation platforms that take away from browsing real websites. In their use of the term ‘handmade web’, the big corporations are leading us to forget the endless possibilities we have. For example, there is X and Instagram, which in itself is the internet, and they are on websites. However, there is more to the internet besides these apps. Not to say that I am one to be scouring the internet more than I spend on Instagram, but venturing out into the unknown is more fun.  </h2>
